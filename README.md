# PSXFunkin Simple Engine
I made that engine in 2 days LOL

## Compilation
Refer to [COMPILE.md](/COMPILE.md) here

## Disclaimer
This project is not endorsed by the original Friday Night Funkin' devs or PSXFunkin devs, this is just an unofficial engine because I was bored.

## Why i should use that engine?
This engine uses what is popular in PSXFunkin modding and tries to make it as simple as possible, this engine is perfect for beginners or for people who don't want to remove all weeks all the time, after all this engine only has week 1
